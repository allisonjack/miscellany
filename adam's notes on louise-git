Basically 
(1) set up the yale git account 
Git.yale.edu ( you need to be on the network or the vpn)
(2) follow these instructions from github (while you’re on louise), but change the addresses to the yale git ones
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

(3) make git use ssh instead of http to connect (this way you don’t have louise trying to open a popup to authenticate you)

(4)Use this, or something else that is painless, on your local machine

(5) use this to move data
